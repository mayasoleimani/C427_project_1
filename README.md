# Winter 2022 CIS 427 Project 1: Client and server
## Collaborators: Maya Soleimani & Nicole Katynski

This is a programn is an implemented online address using TCP sockets that is able to be accessed by client to communicate to a server.

Commands
*ADD- Able to add a first name, last name, and phone number to .txt file.
*DELETE- Able to remove added contact in address book.
*LIST - Able to list contacts that are input by client
*SHUTDOWN- Able to have client shut down both server and client
*QUIT- when commanded on, closes client first, and server disconnects from client.

Current bugs

*When adding a contact, list leaves blank where old contact was and adds to the end of the list.
*When deleting a contact, only the name and phone number are deleted, the address of where they used to be stays.
